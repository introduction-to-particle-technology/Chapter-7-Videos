## Pneumatic Transport

The pneumatic transport of particulate solids is broadly classified into two flow regimes: dilute (or lean) phase flow; and dense phase flow. 
Dilute phase flow in its most recognizable form is characterized by high gas velocities (greater than 20 m/s), low solids concentrations (less than 1% by volume) and low pressure drops per unit length of transport line (typically less than 5 mbar/ m).

Dense phase flow is characterized by low gas velocities (1â€“5 m/s, high solids concentrations (greater than 30% by volume) and high pressure drops per unit length of pipe (typically greater than 20 mbar/m). In dense phase transport, particles are not fully suspended and there is much interaction between them.

The videos in this section show examples of dilute phase flow and dense phase flow. Also included are (i) a simulation of a rotary airlock, a device used for feeding solids into a dilute phase system, (ii) an airslide, and (iii) operation of a blow tank which is used to feed solids into a dense phase system.
