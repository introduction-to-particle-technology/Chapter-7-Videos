## Pneumatic Transport

The pneumatic transport of particulate solids is broadly classified into two flow regimes: dilute (or lean) phase flow; and dense phase flow. 
Dilute phase flow in its most recognizable form is characterized by high gas velocities (greater than 20 m/s), low solids concentrations (less than 1% by volume) and low pressure drops per unit length of transport line (typically less than 5 mbar/ m).

Dense phase flow is characterized by low gas velocities (1â€“5 m/s, high solids concentrations (greater than 30% by volume) and high pressure drops per unit length of pipe (typically greater than 20 mbar/m). In dense phase transport, particles are not fully suspended and there is much interaction between them.
The videos in this section show a simulation of dilute phase flow and several examples of dense phase flow. Also included are (i) a simulation of a rotary airlock, a device used for feeding solids into a dilute phase system, simulation of an airslide and (iii) operation of a blow tank which is used to feed solids into a dense phase system.
